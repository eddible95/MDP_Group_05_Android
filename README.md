# MDP_Group_05_Android

The Android Module written for the Android Application required for CZ3004 Multi Disciplinary Project (MDP).
The Android Application (AA) acts as a wireless remote controller for the team's robotic system. Using the AA, we can issue various commands to our robot to begin various manoeuvres in the maze during the leader board challenge. Communication with the raspberry-Pi and PC will be done solely via Bluetooth.
The AA's Graphical User Interface (GUI) provides the visualisation of the current status of the maze through a graphical 2-D display of the maze as well as the current status of the robot.
